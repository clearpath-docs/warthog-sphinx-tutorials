Installing Warthog Software
=============================

.. note::

  To get started with the Warthog, make sure you have a :roswiki:`working ROS installation <ROS/Installation>`
  set up on your computer.  The physical Warthog robot comes ROS pre-configured, but if you are working
  on your own computer you may need to follow the instructions on the ROS wiki to get set up.

Add Clearpath Debian Package Repository
------------------------------------------

Before you can install the Warthog packages, you need to configure Ubuntu's APT package manager to
add Clearpath's package server.  You can do this by running the following commands in the terminal:

1. First install the authentication key for the packages.clearpathrobotics.com repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/public.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

2. Add the debian sources for the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/stable/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clearpath-latest.list'

3. Update your computer's package cache:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update


Installing the Packages
--------------------------

Now that your computer is configured to use Clearpath's deb repository, you can install the Warthog packages needed
for this tutorial by running the following command:

.. substitution-code-block :: bash

    sudo apt-get install ros-|ros_distro|-warthog-desktop


Installing from Source
---------------------------

The source code for the base Warthog packages is available on GitHub_.  We recommend installing the software through
**apt**, as described above.  But if you want to modify Warthog's behaviour, or simply learn more about how the robot
is configured, you can check out and build the packages yourself.  These instructions assume you are at least somewhat
familiar with building ROS packages using the :roswiki:`Catkin build system <catkin/conceptual_overview>`.

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/warthog-cpr/

First create a workspace directory and initialize it:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir ~/warthog_ws
    cd ~/warthog_ws
    mkdir src
    catkin_init_workspace src

Next clone the Warthog repositories using git:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/warthog_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/warthog-cpr/warthog.git
    git clone https://github.com/warthog-cpr/warthog_simulator.git
    git clone https://github.com/warthog-cpr/warthog_desktop.git

Note that there are three separate git repositories being cloned:

+------------------------+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Git repository         | ROS Packages           | Description                                                         |
+========================+========================+=====================================================================+
| ``warthog``            | * warthog_control      | Common packages for the Warthog platform, including messages and    |
|                        | * warthog_description  | robot description.  These packages are relevant to all workspaces,  |
|                        | * warthog_msgs         | including simulation, desktop, or use on the robot itself.          |
+------------------------+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``warthog_simulator``  | * warthog_gazebo       | Packages essential for running warthog simulations.  Requires the   |
|                        | * warthog_simulator    | packages from the ``warthog`` repository.                           |
+------------------------+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``warthog_desktop``    | * warthog_desktop      | Packages for controlling & monitoring the physical robot and/or     |
|                        | * warthog_viz          | simulation.  Requires the packages from the ``warthog`` repository  |
+------------------------+------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

Now install additional ROS dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/warthog_ws
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=kinetic -y

Finally build the workspace:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/warthog_ws
    catkin_make

You can now source your workspace's in order to make use of the packages you just built:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/warthog_ws
    source devel/setup.bash

To test that everything worked, try running the Warthog simulation that we'll be using in the next portion of this
tutorial:

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch warthog_gazebo warthog_world.launch
