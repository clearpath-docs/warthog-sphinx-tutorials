Installing Warthog Software
=============================

.. note::

  The physical Warthog robot comes pre-configured with ROS and the necessary Warthog packages already installed; therefore, you will only need to follow the instructions below if you are re-installing software on the Warthog.

There are three ways to install Warthog software on the physical Warthog robot.

The first two ways are using the Clearpath Robotics ISO image, and using Debian (``.deb``) packages. These two ways are covered in this section.

The third way is installing from source by directly cloning Clearpath Robotics Github repositories and building them in your ROS (``catkin``) workspace; however, this way is not recommended and will not be covered in this section.

Installing with ISO Image
--------------------------

.. Warning::

  Installing with the Clearpath Robotics ISO image will completely wipe data on the Warthog's computer, since the ISO image will install Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal), ROS Noetic, and Warthog-specific packages.

If you are installing Warthog software on a physical Warthog robot through the Clearpath Robotics ISO image, you will first need a USB drive of at least 2GB to create the installation media, an ethernet cable, a monitor, and a keyboard.

You can download the Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) ROS Noetic ISO image from `here <https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/stable/images/latest/noetic-focal/>`_.

On a separate computer:

1. Download the ``.iso`` file from the link above.

2. Insert the USB drive.

3. Write the downloaded ``.iso`` file to the USB drive using a software such as ``Rufus``, ``Etcher``, or ``UNetbootin``. This will erase all data already on the USB drive, so make sure you have backed up anything important!

On the physical Warthog robot's computer:

1. Ensure that it is turned off.

2. Connect it to the internet via the ethernet cable.

3. Insert the newly formatted USB drive.

4. Turn it on and choose to begin the installation process. The installer should run automatically. 

.. note::

  You may need to configure the computer's BIOS to prioritize booting from the USB drive. On most common motherboards, pressing ``delete`` during the initial startup will open the BIOS for configuration.

5. Step through any prompts that come up. Make sure you select the installation option corresponding to the Warthog, and give the Warthog an appropriate hostname. The computer will turn off automatically when the installation completes.

6. Once the computer turns off, remove the USB drive and turn on the computer. It will now be running your fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) with ROS Noetic, as well as your Warthog-specific packages.

7. The Warthog bringup service must be configured. In terminal, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  rosrun warthog_bringup install
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload

8. Finally, start ROS. In terminal, run:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  sudo systemctl start ros

Installing with Debian Packages
--------------------------------

If you are installing Warthog software on a physical Warthog robot through Debian packages, you will first need to ensure that the Warthog robot's computer is running Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) and ROS Noetic.

**Add Clearpath Debian Package Repository**

Before you can install the Warthog packages, you need to configure Ubuntu's APT package manager to
add Clearpath's package server:

1. Install the authentication key for the packages.clearpathrobotics.com repository. In terminal, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/public.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

2. Add the debian sources for the repository. In terminal, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/stable/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clearpath-latest.list'

3. Update your computer's package cache. In terminal, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update

**Installing Debian Packages**

After the Warthog's computer is configured to use Clearpath's debian package repository, you can install the Warthog packages. 

1. On a physical Warthog robot, you should only need the Warthog robot packages. In terminal, run:

.. code-block :: bash

    sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-warthog-robot

2. The Warthog bringup service must be configured. In terminal, run

.. code-block:: bash

  rosrun warthog_bringup install
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload

3. Finally, start ROS. In terminal, run:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  sudo systemctl start ros

Installing Desktop Software
----------------------------

It is useful to install Warthog's software on your computer for the purpose of interfacing with the physical Warthog robot and/or to run simulations of Warthog.

If you are installing Warthog's software on your computer, you will first need to ensure that your computer is running Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) and ROS Noetic.

1. On your computer, you should only need the Warthog desktop packages. In terminal, run:

.. code-block :: bash

  sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-warthog-desktop ros-noetic-warthog-simulator
